# IDAUSR

This repo is a backup of my IDA Pro user directory which is found at `~/.idapro` on macOS.

The most interesting thing here is the IDAPython code which contains powerful tools for debugging and runtime-introspecting Objective-C and Swift code with IDA. [Jun 5 2025]

Notes:
- [Jun 5 2025] ! Make sure not to leak anything sensitive ! (In case we publish this repo)
- [Apr 19 2025] When I first installed IDA Pro 9.1 earlier today, there was documentation at Help > Help but now it's gone!
